# Countdown Timer - Python

## Description
This Python program functions as a countdown timer. The user inputs a time in seconds, and the program displays the countdown in the format `HH:MM:SS` (hours, minutes, and seconds). It updates every second, and when the countdown reaches zero, the program prints **"TIMES UP!!"**.

## Features
- Accepts time input in seconds.
- Displays the countdown in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Automatically converts the seconds into hours and minutes as needed.
- Pauses for 1 second between each countdown step to simulate the passage of time.
- Notifies the user with **"TIMES UP!!"** when the countdown is complete.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `countdown_timer_program.py` file in a Python environment.
3. Follow the prompt:
   - Enter the desired time in seconds.
4. The program will begin counting down, displaying the time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
5. Once the time reaches zero, the message **"TIMES UP!!"** will be displayed.

## Example
```bash
Enter the time in seconds: 3605
01:00:05
01:00:04
...
00:00:01
TIMES UP!!
